            <p>My name is Laura</p>
            <p> I was born and raised in Switzerland in a Swiss-Italian family. I am passionate about engineering, data analysis and sports. I graduated from ETH Zurich with a Master's degree in Medical Technology. </p>
            <p> I've spent a year in the R&D team of the Swiss exoskeleton company <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://www.auxivo.com/" target="_blank"> Auxivo AG </a></span>, starting with an internship and was then offered my own project for my master's thesis. 
                During my internship I was part of a scientific study evaluating a back and shoulder exoskeleton with physiological measurements and data analysis which led to a <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687024001091" target="_blank"> publication. </a></span></p>
            <!---<p class="quote uppercase center"><span class="colorful-letter">This is important</span> a quote or
                something else.</p>--->
            <p> For my Master's thesis, I investigated the influence of familiarisation on exoskeleton support, developed a study protocol and conducted the study. The study generated a large amount of data which I analysed using <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank"> Matlab. </a></span> 
                After completing my thesis, I had the opportunity to stay with the company to assemble the new <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://www.auxivo.com/eduexo-pro" target="_blank"> EduExo Pro </a></span> and then present it at the <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://www.biorob2024.org/" target="_blank"> BioRob </a></span> conference in Heidelberg (Germany) together with the project manager. </p>

        <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
        <p>My academic journey began when I graduated from the <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://gymnasium-disentis.ch/" target="_blank">International Boarding School </a></span>in Disentis (Switzerland) in 2017 with a major in music and a minor in religious studies.</p>
        <!--<p class="italic">'Disentis Abbey Grammar & Boarding School has been building bridges between cultures, languages and people for over 1400 years.' - Tom Etter, Principal of Disentis Abbey Grammar & Boarding School</p>
        -->
        <p>During my gap year I worked as a nurse in a psychiatric hospital for seven months and as a biomedical analyst in an analytical laboratory for four months which sparked my interest in medical analytics. I started my Bachelor's degree in Health Science and Technology at <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank"> ETH Zurich</a></span> in 2018.</p>
        <p>After a two-year foundation course, I was able to specialise and chose to combine computational research and analysis with biomechanics and sports science, which I then deepened in my Master's degree in Medical Technology. </p>

            <h2 class="main-title-large">Motorsports</h2>
            <p>
                My fascination with motorsport began with Formula 1. Every race weekend, my friends and family get together to spend time together, with the race being a highlight of the weekend. As my interest and knowledge grew over time, I began to look at other series as well and developed an interest in endurance racing and the DTM.
            </p>
            <p>
                What fascinates me is that although these disciplines all involve fast cars, each car has to be uniquely built to meet the specific demands of its discipline. Also, each motorsport discipline has its own atmosphere and the passion and spirit of the teams is incredibly contagious.
                In 2023, I started to combine my love of engineering and data analysis with my passion for sports by analysing open-source Formula 1 data. I find it fascinating how motorsport makes engineering competitive. Being part of a motorsport team is a big dream of mine.

                <p class="bold center">Dog sports</p>
                <p> I grew up participating in dog sports and <span class="bold colorful-letter"><a class="link" href="https://www.tkjh.ch/rule-pr%C3%BCfung/" target="_blank"> championships </a></span> with my Labrador Retriever, Jessie. From an early age, this experience taught me the importance of teamwork and dedication. Since 2015, I’ve stepped back from major championships, but I still enjoy participating in smaller competitions for fun with a friend’s dogs.
                    As Christl Faltner once said, 'No dog is born world champion, it's the team that makes the titles. It's the time, the energy, and the love we put into what we do together.' This resonates deeply with me because the bond and commitment between the handler and the dog are what lead to success and the team’s synergy is vital to victory.
